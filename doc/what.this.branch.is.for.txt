On branch testing-hh-ii-

This is branch testing-hh-ii- which is a modification of testing-hh-

It is meant as a temporary development area to be merged back
into the testing-hh- branch (only).

When branch testing-hh- looks more useful, can consider merging
it back into its parent (testing-gg-).  Branch testing-gg- is eligible
to be merged into master, so it is looked over more carefully than
these shorter-term branches are.
