Primitive mass storage of forth code stored as ascii plaintext
on the Adafruit SPI flashROM (found on the Express series, such
as the Circuit Playground Express).

new vocabulary:
 load echo! download

The 'load' word enables reading in of a stored program from 
the SPI flashROM.


The 'echo!' word decides if to echo the forth source to the
terminal, during the 'load' word. 


The 'download' word reads from the serial terminal, and
stores whatever it sees to flashROM.  It appends to a single
file.  No method is provided to reset the file to zero-length;
it just keeps growing the more it is used for storage.

Addressing that is potentially a TODO item, though this is
an experiment (November 24 2017, and since August 2017).

Use the delimiter '\end.' (without enclosing apostrophes)
to end the download and append the download'ed source
to SPI flashROM.  Do this on a new input line, at the
very left margin.

Note: colon definitions are optional inside the download.
The entire mechanism is just a player-piano and is a
direct substitute for typing during a session with the
machine, via USB serial.  It follows the same heuristics
(rules of thumb) as a standard, interactive session with
the machine via USB serial.

There may be errors in this document as it was written
long after the code was written, with a long haitus in
between these two events.

END.
