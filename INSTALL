Basic Installation
==================

   Briefly, you are looking at a skeleton file acting as a place-
holder for any installation instructions offered.

  1. July 2017: configured for Circuit Playground Express (#3333),
                which is the current target MCU under development.

                This changes frequently, and may be near the top
                of the list of gotchas to watch for: a different
                'Express' series target (Feather M0, Metro M0, et al.)
                can break compiles -- or can crash the target MCU
                after an upload (generally easy to resolve).

                Note that this is not an Arduino IDE problem -- it
                persists even after proper selection of the target
                MCU in the Arduino IDE interface.

                The problem is that, currently, ainsuForth does not
                (always) detect (or compensate for) a change in
                targets.  It is only periodically tested against
                each of these four SAMD21 design targets:

                       Arduino M0 Pro
                       Adafruit Feather M0 Express
                       Adafruit Metro M0 Express
                       Adafruit Circuit Playground Express (#3333)
     Currently:

     src/periph/neo_pixel.cpp is affected (pin 8 vs pin 40 of the Metro)

     There may be other target-specific issues to resolve, when
     using another target MCU board in this (Adafruit Express SAMD21) family.

     Eventually, some kind of #define-based configuration may be employed.

  2. Install something.
  3. Install something else.  Then install a thing.  Continue installing
     until installation is complete.
  4. These last three line items (2, 3 and 4) are meant as place-holders
     for instructions, rather than as instructions.


Compilers and Options
=====================

   This would be a good place to talk about the compiler.

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   This might talk about #define and #include directives to the C
preprocessor.

Installation Names
==================

   This section may talk about makefile targets, if there were any.

Optional Features
=================

   This would possibly be more specific to individual, well-known
features the program may (optionally) incorporate.  Or not.

Particular systems
==================

   This might talk about Linux or about some other kind of system
(name your system here; for example, Solaris).


Other
=====

This INSTALL file format doesn't very well fit present needs.

It is here to remind what sorts of standard files are often
seen in distributed packages.
