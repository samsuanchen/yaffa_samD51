This is what's wrong with JEDEC:

Somehow (I use CircuitPython, personally) the directory, /forth must
exist.  A file, ascii_xfer_a001.txt must exist.

Have not settled on how to automate this (existing example code
for Arduino and SPI flashROM is sufficient, here .. hasn't been
implemented for ainsuForth).

$ ag 001.txt
src/kernel/getline.cpp
35:#define SPI_FlashROM_FILENAME "/forth/ascii_xfer_a001.txt"
