MOTIVATION

ainsuForth is intended as the most (or nearly most) minimal
implementation of a functioning YAFFA-like Forth, on the Cortex M0+
architecture -- measured by the number of bytes occupying flashROM.

This would (perhaps) entail auditing the development environment
(Arduino IDE) looking for ways to remove uncalled vocabularies
(subroutines that do nothing in the uploaded .HEX image -- dead
code, essentially: unused library calls).

 . . .

This is the primary motivation behind the pursuit of a smaller
program; one that is broken down into more manageable-
sized chunks:

        .. so that one person may see it more clearly,
        without undue study of side-issues that don't
        affect the immediate requirements of that
        one person.



Caveat


This is a growth-document: it states ideas rather assuredly that,
in truth, are more experimental in nature.  That is, the ideas are
only the working ideas of the moment; they are not quite afforded
the same standing as other expressed ideas (from the author, and
from others) that have withstood test, and experimentation.
