This is a skeletal file and at the moment is to be ignored, as
are most of the files added or modified on June 6, 2017.

NEXT:
	Sun Jul 30 02:55:32 UTC 2017
	Cycle Metro source to Feather, then to CPX and clone CPX back
	to the base program (ainsuForth).

	Develop for CPX, moving (possibly) into SPI flash stuff.

OLD_NEXT:
	Thu Jun  8 21:52:01 UTC 2017
	in HARDWARE.local.txt:

        blinkApp needs to be factored - has stack management kludge(s).

OLDER_NEXT:
	Tue Jun  6 19:06:03 UTC 2017

	Try splitting and renaming and relocating code, without the
	removal of commented code (from Dictionary.ino comment.)


OLDEST_NEXT:
	Tue Jun  6 05:32:17 UTC 2017

	finish stripping the program prior to putting the pieces back
	together again, restructured along different principles.

The rest of this file is facetious.

BEFORE RELEASE:
	fix this and that.
	fix something broken.
	break something, then fix it.
	fix something that isn't broken.

FEATURES:
	Happy fun bar
	Smoothed curves (on the box the project is housed in)
	ANSI.  Got to have ANSI.

EASY FIXES:
	Be sure that the 'warm' word is defined.

-----------------------------------------

RATHER HARD FIXES, SHOULD BE DONE BUT NOT MANDATORY FOR RELEASE:
	Make it hover in mid-air, but draw no power at all.
	3-D print a gallon of drinking water, including the water.

FEATURE WISHLIST (i.e. unlikely to get done):
	Convert to a tethered Forth.
	Mirror images of all LCD messages (so they can be seen in, you guessed it, a mirror).
	Popcorn.  It should make popcorn.

MISC FIXES (i.e. will never get done):
	Retinal tracking.
	Paintball socket.
	Unit made so small, it is difficult to find, even when it's already in your hand.
