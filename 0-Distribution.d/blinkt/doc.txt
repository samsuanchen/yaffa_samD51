time index 5:51:

   4 bytes of 0's to start (start byte)

   then:

   bright    blue     green    red    

   then (optional!)
   4 bytes of 1's to end frame.

time index ... 10:26 ending

   START 32-led-a 32-led-b 32-led-c

   You just keep sending 32-bit sequences to the strip;
   when an indvidual APA102 is fully defined (in just 32 bits)
   the very next sequence of 32-bits acts on the next APA102
   on the strip!

   "It has built a sort of bypass around itself" after
   receiving its 32-bit instruction (8 brightness bits,
   8 blue bits, 8 green bits and 8 red bits for 32 bits
   in total -- a complete instruction to any APA102,
   so long as the 32-bit value of 0 is sent as the 'start'
   byte -- once -- for an entire string of APA102's).
